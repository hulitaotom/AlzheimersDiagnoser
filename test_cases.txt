We are building a test-bot for Alzheimer's disease. 

Press the start button to begin the test. 
When you see the initial greeting text, just type anything, i.e. hello. 
Then follow the instruction to input your name, gender and age. 
The test will then begin. 
You could type in anything as answer (they will be treated as wrong answers)

Here is the correct answer for your reference: 
Picture recognition type: 1. volcano 2. funnel 3. apple
Math Type: 1. 7   2. 2.45   3. 11
Memory Test: simply re-type the sentence
President of US: Donald Trump / Trump
Currency name: any currency name you could think of i.e. RMB, USD, HKD

for the picture recognition type problem and math problem, if you answer is wrong, you will be asked to do a similar problem for at most twice. 
if your answer is correct, then the test will continue to the next type of problem.
